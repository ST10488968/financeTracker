Brief Explanation
---------------------

In this program, a user inputs their income and their expenses and the program gives feedback on how the user is managing their expenses based on their income. 
If in the case that invalid values are entered, such as empty or non-numeric values, a Toast message is displayed (unfortunately a screenshot could not be provide as the message appears and
disappears too quickly to capture a screenshot), which stops any calculations.
In terms of expense calculation, the program calculates the total of all the input expenses, and the balance is calculated as "Income - Total Expenses". If the balance is positive, a display
saying the user is saving money, as shown in 'Positive Balance Screenshot'. If negative, a message displaying the user is not managing their expenses responsibly is shown, which can be seen
in 'Negative Balance Screenshot'.
